								<h2>SHOCKTOP </h2>
									<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
									<p>Shock Top is a traditional Belgian-style wheat ale that was originally introduced in 2006 as a seasonal offering. After taking home the gold medal in the gold medal at the North American Beer Awards in the Belgian White category, it became a year-round offering. Shock Top’s flagship beer, the Belgian White, is brewed with two-row barley and imported Hallertau hops that are blended with Cascade and Willamette hops. Its citrus notes come from the orange, lemon and lime peels that are added to the brew kettle during the brewing process. This unfiltered ale has a naturally cloudy and light golden colour with a smooth, refreshing taste.</p>

								<h2>Possible Makeover</h2>
								<p>As part of the refresh, Shock Top will get a full makeover, and the changes will be reflected across all brand assets and activations. Moving away from its irreverent roots, the brand will take on a more inspiring, uplifting approach. Its packaging will feature a dynamic look sporting a fresh new logo, hand-drawn graphics and a reinvigorated "Wedgehead."
								Shock Top’s new designs will be carried through all consumer-facing activations including advertising, in-store, on-premise and online.</p>

								<h2>New Flavours</h2>
								<p>With these new flavours, Shock Top is infusing unique ingredients into its brews to create a new experience, the company said.
								Holy Citrus is brewed with Buddha’s Hand, one of the oldest citrus fruits often described as “lemon with fingers,” and known for its sweet floral fragrance and mild zest.
								Ruby Fresh aims to balance the sweetness and tartness of grapefruit for a new take on Shock Top.
								And these are just the start for Shock Top with a number of new citrus flavours brewing up to launch in its seasonal variety citrus packs for summer, fall and winter, the company said.
								Shock Top will continue to offer its signature Belgian-style wheat ale, Belgian White, along with its popular Lemon Shandy, coupled with a new lineup of seasonal beers packed with citrus. Launched in stores late February, Shock Top’s first new seasonal release will be its Citrus Variety Pack featuring Belgian White and Lemon Shandy, alongside two entirely new flavours: Holy Citrus and Ruby Fresh.</p>

								<h2>Varieties</h2>
								<p>Shock Top Wheat IPA (WIPA) is not a traditional beer. It’s a unique hybrid that brings the refreshment and smoothness of a wheat beer and marries it with the crisp hop bitterness of an IPA. The result is a beer like no other
								Shock Top has many different varieties, with more being developed constantly. The main varieties of Shock Top are Raspberry Wheat, Honeycrisp Apple Wheat, Lemon Shandy (Summer seasonal), Pumpkin Wheat (Fall seasonal), Wheat IPA, Chocolate Wheat (Winter Seasonal), and Honey Bourbon Cask Wheat.
								Special varieties of Shock Top include End of the World Midnight Wheat (Fall/Winter 2012 seasonal), Twisted Pretzel Wheat (Summer 2014 seasonal), and Banana Spice Wheat (Summer 2014 seasonal). </p>
